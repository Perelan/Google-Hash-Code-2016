# Google Hash Code 2016
This is our contribution to the Google Hash Code 2016. We never did achieve any correct output, neither did we complete the whole task. However we considered this a very fun experience, and learned a lot how to apply our existing knowledge to realistic problems! We managed to model the majority of the system, and implemented it in java.
